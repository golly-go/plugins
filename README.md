# golly-plugins

As we aim to keep Golly agnostic and open for your usecase, we have seperated functionality into a more plugable format
the plugins can be loaded independently as not to increase depenency or binary size:

## Plugins

- [ORM](https://github.com/golly-go/plugins/blob/main/orm/README.md)
- [KAFKA](https://github.com/golly-go/plugins/blob/main/kafka/README.md)
